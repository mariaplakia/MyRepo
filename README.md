# Intelligencia Run Script

1. Add in the configuration file username,password and port of your postgress database
2. Just run the .py script in the MyRepo\intelligencia_assign directory (use command line)

A way to schedule the script in Windows would be with windows task scheduler
We could use kubernettes jobs if we have an environment to schedule it on linux
There are several other tools to schedule like Azure Databricks, Airflow etc. It depends from the stack used.
